## ADR-001: Single Source of Truth for Market Data

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 03-Aug-2026

### Context

The initial implementation overlaid live Yahoo Finance prices onto seeded demo data.

This resulted in inconsistencies such as:

- Live Price from Yahoo Finance
- Seed-generated EMA
- Seed-generated RSI
- Seed-generated VWAP
- Seed-generated chart
- AI insights based on seed indicators

Although useful as a proof of concept, this architecture produced misleading analysis.

### Decision

TradeLens shall use **one and only one source of market data** for each response.

All technical indicators, charts, AI insights and trading recommendations must be derived from the same OHLCV dataset.

### Consequences

Benefits

- Consistent charts
- Consistent indicators
- Trustworthy AI explanations
- Easier testing
- Easy provider replacement (Yahoo, Zerodha, Upstox, etc.)

Trade-offs

- Slightly more computation
- Requires historical data retrieval
- Indicator engine must be implemented
